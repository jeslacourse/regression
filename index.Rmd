**In Summary**
:::

This text serves as a personal notebook for my regression notes. It's also a space to explore different formats and styles for sharing information. This version is written in Rstudio using bookdown and bootstrap.

**Linear Regression** is the measure of the linear relationship between two variables. 

Regression is used for both observational studies and experimental studies. **Observational studies** are experiments with no manipulation from the researcher and treatments are not randomized. **Experimental studies** allow the researcher to manipulate explanatory variables but the treatment of data must be randomized.
